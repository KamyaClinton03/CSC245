# CSC245 - Mario Kart Leaderboard 

For this project I created a Mario Kart-themed leaderboard and random match generator to help my friends and me stay connected and have some fun while we're away at college. 

The leaderboard keeps track of our wins and losses while the match generator creates random pairings.
